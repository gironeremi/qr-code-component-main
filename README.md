## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (such as variables, I didn't used it before! What a discover!)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (well, the design is exactly the same for this project)
- React, nope. NextJs, not yet, maybe soon!

### What I learned

I'm so proud about my CSS. For sure, it's not perfect and correctly refactored, but it's a good re-birth!

I forgot that we can calculate directly in CSS.
```css
  width: calc(320px - var(--padding)*2);
```
**It's a game changer for me.**

### Continued development

It would be great to refactor the CSS or re-organise some HTML tags.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools Lessons](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp) :  It's still a **GOLDMINE** to find a forgot command.
- [ChatGPT] : I didn't know we could calculate and create variables in modern CSS.
